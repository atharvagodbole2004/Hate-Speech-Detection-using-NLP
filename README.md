# Hate-Speech-Detection-using-NLP
This notebook builds a hate speech classifier using a Bidirectional LSTM. It preprocesses tweets with NLP techniques, balances the imbalanced dataset via sampling, and trains the model with Keras. The final model reaches ~98.7% validation accuracy, using EarlyStopping to mitigate overfitting.
